Steps to run the project:

```npm start```

Steps to create this project:

1. Run `npm init -y` to create the package.yaml
2. Add `index.html` and `index.js` files. Project can then be built and started with `parcel index.html` if you have parcel installed globally.
3. So you donâ€™t need parcel installed globally, run `npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev` to install it as a local dev package.
4. Add npm scripts for starting (`parcel index.html`) and building the project (`parcel build index.html`).
